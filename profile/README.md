# **Top Accessories to Pair with Your Ram Tonneau Cover**  

Your Ram truck isn’t just a vehicle—it’s a statement of power, versatility, and reliability. Adding a tonneau cover is one of the most effective ways to protect your truck bed and cargo while enhancing the truck's sleek appearance. But why stop there? Pairing your tonneau cover with the right accessories can elevate your truck's functionality, durability, and convenience to the next level. Here’s a detailed guide to the top accessories that complement your Ram tonneau cover perfectly.  

## **Introduction**  

A [tonneau cover](https://bisontonneaucovers.com/collections/bison-tonneau-covers) shields your truck bed from the elements, enhances fuel efficiency by reducing drag, and secures your belongings. However, combining it with additional accessories can create a truck bed setup tailored to your needs. Whether you’re hauling tools for work, packing for a camping trip, or securing expensive gear, these accessories ensure maximum utility and protection.  

## **Bed Liners**  

A bed liner is essential for protecting your truck bed from scratches, dents, and corrosion. There are three primary types:  

- **Spray-On Bed Liners:** Provide a permanent, seamless layer of protection and resist scratches and chemicals.  
- **Drop-In Bed Liners:** These are easy to install and remove, offering excellent protection against heavy impacts.  
- **Carpeted Bed Liners:** Perfect for those seeking a softer surface to protect delicate cargo.  

By pairing a bed liner with your tonneau cover, you can shield both your truck bed and its contents from damage caused by shifting or heavy loads.  

## **Tailgate Seals**  

Tailgate seals work alongside your tonneau cover to create a tight barrier, preventing dust, dirt, and water from entering your truck bed. They’re especially useful for off-road enthusiasts or anyone frequently driving on unpaved roads. With a proper tailgate seal, you can trust that your cargo will remain clean and dry, regardless of the terrain or weather conditions.  

## **Truck Bed Lighting**  

Visibility is crucial, especially when loading or unloading your truck at night or in dimly lit areas. Truck bed lighting options, such as LED strip lights or portable magnetic lights, provide clear illumination under your tonneau cover. Many lighting systems are battery-operated, while others can be hardwired into your truck for convenience.  

## **Cargo Management Systems**  

Keeping your cargo organized and secure is a breeze with a well-thought-out cargo management system. Here are some popular options:  

- **Tie-Down Anchors and Cargo Nets:** Prevent items from sliding around during transit.  
- **Sliding Bed Trays:** Make loading and unloading easier by allowing you to access items at the back of the bed without climbing in.  
- **Bed Extenders:** Perfect for carrying oversized items like lumber or bikes.  

These systems work seamlessly with tonneau covers to keep your gear safe and accessible.  

## **Toolboxes**  

For those who rely on their Ram truck for work, a compatible toolbox is a must. Choose a low-profile toolbox that fits beneath your tonneau cover to maintain security and aerodynamics. These boxes provide ample storage for tools and equipment, ensuring they’re safe from theft and the elements.  

## **Tailgate Assist Systems**  

A tailgate assist system makes opening and closing your tailgate smoother and safer. These systems use gas struts to control the tailgate's motion, preventing sudden drops. It’s a simple addition that greatly improves convenience, especially when your hands are full.  

## **Bed Racks**  

If you’re an adventurer who needs to transport kayaks, bikes, or other oversized items, bed racks are the ideal accessory. Available in various styles—such as utility racks, sports racks, and ladder racks—bed racks enhance your truck’s versatility without interfering with your tonneau cover.  

## **Bed Mats**  

While bed liners protect your truck bed, bed mats offer an extra layer of cushioning and grip. They’re ideal for preventing cargo from sliding and providing a softer surface for delicate items. Unlike permanent bed liners, mats can be easily removed for cleaning or replacement.  

## **Weatherproof Storage Bags**  

Keep your gear safe from rain, snow, and dirt with weatherproof storage bags. These bags come in various sizes and fit snugly under your tonneau cover, offering a secure and organized way to store your belongings.  

## **Tailgate Lock Systems**  

A tailgate lock system adds an extra layer of security to your truck. Whether you’re parked in a public lot or leaving your truck overnight, a tailgate lock ensures that both your tonneau cover and tailgate remain firmly secured, deterring potential theft.  

## **Load Stops and Cleats**  

Heavy cargo requires more than just a tonneau cover for protection. Load stops and cleats keep your items firmly in place, preventing movement that could cause damage. These accessories are easy to install and can be adjusted to accommodate various cargo sizes.  

## **Bed Dividers**  

Bed dividers help you organize your truck bed by creating separate compartments. This accessory is perfect for keeping tools, groceries, or sports equipment neatly sorted. Adjustable bed dividers allow you to customize your truck bed layout based on your needs.  

## **Bike and Kayak Mounts**  

Outdoor enthusiasts will appreciate the convenience of bike and kayak mounts. These accessories ensure safe and secure transport of your recreational gear, freeing up space in your truck bed while maintaining compatibility with your tonneau cover.  

## **Maintenance Tips for Tonneau Covers and Accessories**  

To keep your tonneau cover and accessories in top condition, follow these maintenance tips:  

- **Cleaning:** Use mild soap and water to clean the cover and accessories regularly. Avoid abrasive cleaners.  
- **Lubrication:** Keep moving parts, such as hinges and locks, well-lubricated to prevent rust.  
- **Inspection:** Periodically check for wear and tear, ensuring all components remain secure and functional.  

## **Conclusion**  

By pairing your [Ram tonneau cover](https://bisontonneaucovers.com/collections/dodge) with these top accessories, you can maximize your truck's potential, enhance its functionality, and ensure long-term durability.
